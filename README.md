# Welcome!

Hi! I'm Daniel, and I'm passionate about programming and math!

I graduated in Cinema and specialized in video editing and image post-production. I worked in the field for over ten years, but a mix of lack of opportunities and an interest in programming and artificial intelligence made me try new beginnings.

About four years ago I decided to give programming a chance and what started out as a way to ensure a more stable future has also become a passion.
