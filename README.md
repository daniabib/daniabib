### Hi! :wave:

I'm Daniel, and I'm a self-taught Machine Learning developer from Brazil :brazil: 

ðŸŽ“ I graduated in Cinema and specialized in video editing and image post-production. I worked in the field for over ten years, but a mix of lack of opportunities and an interest in programming and artificial intelligence made me try new beginnings.

About four years ago I decided to give programming a chance and what started out as a way to ensure a more stable future has also become a passion.

Now I like to build intelligent systems for computer vision.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) on weekdays and Haskell on weekends.
